# Multi-Level Referral Commission Rules

Referral & Grow : Invite friends, build your network, and receive extra commissions up to 5 levels.

#### ðŸ”¹ Commission Structure

Every **PocketOffer** user gets a unique referral link. When a new player joins and earns rewards through that link, commissions are distributed across 5 levels:

* Level 1 (Direct Invite): 5%
* Level 2: 3%
* Level 3: 2%
* Level 4: 2%
* Level 5: 3%

Total: 15% commission distributed across the referral tree.

***

#### ðŸ”¹ Example

* A invites B â†’ A earns 5% of Bâ€™s rewards.
* B invites C â†’ A earns 3%, B earns 5%.
* C invites D â†’ A earns 2%, B earns 3%, C earns 5%.
* â€¦ continues down to level 5.

***

#### ðŸ”¹ Conditions

* Commissions are only paid when the referred player completes valid in-game actions (install, reach a level, meet retention goals, etc.).
* Rewards are credited in $POFT.
* Only unique, non-fraudulent users are eligible.

***

#### ðŸ”¹ Anti-Abuse Policy

* **PocketOffer** reserves the right to withhold or revoke commissions if fraud is detected:
* Fake accounts / bot traffic.
* Spam or malicious referral activity.
* Multi-account self-referrals.
