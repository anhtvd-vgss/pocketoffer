**Unqualified Users (fewer than 10 tasks):**&#x20;

1. To encourage long-term commitment, only users who complete 10 tasks or more can unlock 100% of the reward benefits. If users who are not yet qualified in the required date, 50% of their POFT tokens are burned, while the remaining 50% is redistributed back into the Reward Pool to strengthen sustainable value for the entire community.
   1. 50% of their POFT tokens are burned.
   2. 50% of their POFT tokens are returned to the reward pool for other players.
